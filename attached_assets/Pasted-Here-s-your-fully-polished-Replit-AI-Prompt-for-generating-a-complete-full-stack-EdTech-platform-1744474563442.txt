🧠 **Replit AI Prompt: Build a Full-Stack EdTech Platform with Compiler, Quizzes & Zoom Integration**

Create a full-featured EdTech platform inspired by **Udemy**, **Coursera**, and **Microsoft Teams**, including professional UI/UX, real-time chat, gamified progress tracking, code compiler integration, and Zoom-based live sessions.

---

## 📁 **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Vite  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript  
- **Database**: JSON-based DB or MongoDB (if needed)  
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO  
- **Compiler**: Use a dummy backend endpoint to simulate a compiler output (bonus if integrating real APIs like Judge0)  
- **Live Sessions**: Zoom API (via JWT/OAuth)  
- **Animations**: Framer-motion (optional but encouraged)

---

## 🔐 **Authentication**

- Only allow 2 hardcoded users:  
  - Username: `Madhavan`, Password: `Test@1234`  
  - Username: `Elevated`, Password: `Teach@1234`  
- No signup route.  
- Frontend uses Context API for auth state.  
- Backend endpoint `/api/login` validates credentials.

## 🏠 **Landing Page (Static)**

- Hero section with CTA: “Explore Courses” & “Login”
- Fully responsive with TailwindCSS
- Toggleable Light/Dark mode
